Hey reader!
welcome to this simple chatbot project which I made using HTML,CSS, JavaScript and fast API (python backend).
I made this project get a good grasp about how to work with Fast API and gemini API 
And turns out that it works really good.

so you can just copy the code and folder format and run it locally using 
pyhton app.py
