Hey reader!
welcome to this simple chatbot project which I made using HTML,CSS, JavaScript and fast API (python backend).
I made this project get a good grasp about how to work with Fast API and gemini API 
And turns out that it works really good.

so you can just copy the code and folder format
simple-chat-bot/
│
├─ app.py               
├─ requirements.txt    
├─ templates/
│   └─ index.html      
├─ static/
│   ├─ style.css
│   └─ script.js
└─ README.md

then replace your API key in the py code
and run it locally using 
pyhton app.py
then you will get a link 
http://127.0.0.1:5000
visit the link
And Kudos! your chat bot is working
